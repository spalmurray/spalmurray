### Hey there!

My name is Spencer and I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto! 
I enjoy making stuff and learning about pretty much anything that seems interesting to me ðŸ˜…

Here's a summary of what I've got going on:


- ðŸ˜„ My cousin and I are working on a neat project for the Raspberry Pi Pico- this is my first time working with 
  tech like this and I'm very excited to learn more!
  
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently interning at Relevant Bits where I'm working on a cool project and learning a lot!

- ðŸŒ± I'm taking an algorithms course at school, which happens to be pretty interesting.

Feel free to get in touch for any reason!
