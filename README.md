### Hey there!

My name is Spencer and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto! Here's a bit about what's going on with me:

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently interning at Relevant Bits where I'm working on a cool project and learning a lot!

- ğŸŒ± I'm taking an algorithms course at school, which is pretty interesting.

Feel free to get in touch for any reason ğŸ˜„
