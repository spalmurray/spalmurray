### Hey!

My name is Spencer and I'm a CS student! Here's a bit about what's going on with me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting Newt available for us to use online and also on making my card-centering tool a web front end using Flask.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about different web technologies and how to apply them in my projects. In school, I just finished up a semester with courses about Software Design and Data Structures.

- âš¡ I am currently looking for a Summer 2022 Internship!
