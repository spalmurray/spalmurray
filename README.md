### Hey!

My name is Spencer and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto! Here's a bit about what's going on with me:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on making my card-centering tool a web UI, as the person who I created the tool for isn't up for running a Python script, which I can't blame them for...

- ðŸŒ± At the moment, I'm learning about different web technologies and how to apply them in my projects. In school, I'm currently taking courses about Algorithms, Databases, UI/UX Design, and C!

- âš¡ I am currently looking for a Summer 2022 Internship!
